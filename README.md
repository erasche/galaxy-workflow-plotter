# Galaxy Workflow Plotter

A minimal D3 based workflow plotter with some small plot customisation options.

This was built due to the fact that Galaxy uses lots of HTML, Canvas, and other
non-scalable stuff in their workflow view. We also don't need some of the
complexity of the workflow view like # of inputs or outputs in a particular
tool, users are more focused on data flow.
